Contributing Guide
==================

This is an open source repository, and we appreciate your contributions. Use this guide to learn how you can be involved.

Requirements
------------

1. You should discuss your change with a ProKnow developer before you begin. We know your time is valuable, and submitting a proposal of your change on our `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/proknow/proknow-python/issues>`_ is a great way to ensure that you will be working on something that we will likely merge once you submit a pull request.
2. You should follow the existing coding styles. We try to follow the guidelines presented in :pep:`8`. Should you find code that not comply with these guidelines, please bring it to our attention so that we may address it.
3. You should have a ProKnow DS account to run basic tests on your changes. If you do not have an account but still wish to contribute, please contact us at support@proknow.com.

Accepted Contributions
----------------------

1. New features.
2. Bug fixes.
3. Documentation.
4. Tests.

We are unlikely to accept pull requests that modify the license or change the way we publish and deploy. For example, we would not accept a change that separated the source and build directories because it would change the way we published the documentation.
